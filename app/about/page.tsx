        <h2 className='mb-16'>My previous experiences, skills and where to find me</h2>
        <p>I am Gabriel Lucena, a tech artist from Natal, RN, Brazil, where I also currently live. I have 4 years of relevant work experience as tech artist. In social media, I use the username "fr4ct1ons".</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a full stack web developer at Instituto Metr√≥pole Digital, at the local college, but I've worked as Tech Artist on <i>One Lonely Outpost</i>, <i>Steampunk Shinobi</i> and as a VFX Artist on <i>Rise of the Third Power</i>.</p>
        <p>As a tech artist, my main specialties are visual effects, shaders, lighting, post processing and rendering, though I also work with 3D modelling/texturing, programming and setting up animations in-engine.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I'm pursuing a Master's in Information Technology, in which I'm researching the implementation of a cel shader in Unreal Engine 5. I also have a Bachelor's in I.T., which I studied from 2018 to 2022.</p>
        <p>I speak english and portuguese fluently, and I also have been taking french lessons and can speak basic french.</p>
